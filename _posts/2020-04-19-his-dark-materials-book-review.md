### Story line so far

##### Jordan College and the Aliethiometer

At Jordan college a girl called lyra, who is the main character, loves playing on rooftops and exploring with her friend Roger. Her Uncle Lord Asriel (a well-known traveller) One day Lyra and Roger heard about the Gobblers. The gobblers have been snatching children from all over the country. Another day in Jordan Lyra was going back to the college, when she reached the college she went and tried to find her best friend (Roger) she looked everywhere the kitchen where Roger worked and even the resting place of the past Masters of Jordan College. He was nowhere! Lyra then had dinner with the master and some other scholars. She was sat next to Mrs Coulter who she was very interested in because she told amazing stories of adventures to the north and political events. After the dinner she was invited to the master’s office to talk with. Lyra was curious. The master was saying that he loved her at Jordan college, but her time was over at college and maybe her place is with one of the women scholars. Then Mrs Coulter walked in and Lyra was ecstatic that she got to go with this exciting woman. One of the maids woke her up early the next morning and told her to go to the master’s office, so she did. She knocked on the window of the door and the master said come in so she walked in to lodge and took a seat. The master asked her to promise that she will keep this secret from Mrs Coulter. He passed over a package wrapped with a cloth over it, Lyra took of the cloth to show a golden object called an aliethiometer, which shows the truth. The master was about to say something about Lord Asriel
