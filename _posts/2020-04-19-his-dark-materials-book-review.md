### Story line so far

##### Jordan College and the Aliethiometer

At Jordan college a girl called lyra, who is the main character, loves playing on rooftops and exploring with her friend Roger. Her Uncle Lord Asriel (a well-known traveller) One day Lyra and Roger heard about the Gobblers. The gobblers have been snatching children from all over the country. Another day in Jordan Lyra was going back to the college, when she reached the college she went and tried to find her best friend (Roger) she looked everywhere the kitchen where Roger worked and even the resting place of the past Masters of Jordan College. He was nowhere! Lyra then had dinner with the master and some other scholars. She was sat next to Mrs Coulter who she was very interested in because she told amazing stories of adventures to the north and political events. After the dinner she was invited to the master’s office to talk with. Lyra was curious. The master was saying that he loved her at Jordan college, but her time was over at college and maybe her place is with one of the women scholars. Then Mrs Coulter walked in and Lyra was ecstatic that she got to go with this exciting woman. One of the maids woke her up early the next morning and told her to go to the master’s office, so she did. She knocked on the window of the door and the master said come in so she walked in to lodge and took a seat. The master asked her to promise that she will keep this secret from Mrs Coulter. He passed over a package wrapped with a cloth over it, Lyra took of the cloth to show a golden object called an aliethiometer, which shows the truth. The master was about to say something about Lord Asriel but then there was a knock on the door and he quickly ushered her to the door. Lyra went back to her room and started packing her stuff for the trip to London with Mrs Coulter. In a bit they were on the airship to London.

##### London with Mrs Coulter

When they got to London Mrs coulter took Lyra to her luxurious apartment, Lyra was amazed. Mrs coulter took her in to the bathroom to get washed and cleaned. After she was washed up, Mrs Coulter took her into the bedroom to get some better clothes on instead of clothes covered in dust and grime. Lyra felt much better after she was all washed up and dressed. Mrs Coulter and Lyra then went to a museum to eat and talk to many poch and famous people. Some day later, Lyra and Mrs Coulter organised a cocktail party with many important people got invites to attend. At the party lyra overheard that Mrs Coulter was head of The Oblation Board a.k.a The Gobblers. Lyra was so angry about this and ran away during the party. Lyra ran and ran until she thought she was safe. When she stopped some men came and trued to beat her up but the gyptians (her friends) came and saved her and invited her to stay on their boat. Ma Costa, who's boy (billy) was took by the gobblers, was there to greet her.

##### To the Gyptian meeting

Lyra went to sleep and the next morning helped Ma Costa do the household jobs, whilst meanwhile a city wide man hunt was happening to find Lyra so she wasn't allowed above deck of the ship, which was sailing to a Gyptian meeting to discuss what to do about the child-snatching gobblers. When they arrived at the meeting John Faa (Western king of the gyptians) was standing at the front of the hall. In the meeting they figured out a plan they would send a team of men and Lyra because she could sort of read the alethiometer to the North to try free all the children there and bring them back home.Also during the meeting Lyra learned he proper parents, Lord Asriel and Mrs Coulter.

##### The travel to the North 

The trip was hard, for the waves were violent and choppy making the ship unberable to live on, even for the few days they were on it. Lyra was seasick for she couldnt go out to the deck of the ship for the hunt was still on for Lyra. In the time she was in the boat she started learning how to read the alethiometer. Her daemon (their life-long animal companions) turned inot a seagull and started flying above deck in enjoyment wich made Lyra feel better. A couple of days after they set off they landed in a small village and took of the supplies for they were going on foot from here. Lyra and John Faa went to a witch outpost and sent a message to one of John Faa's old friends. THe witches daemon flew to there boat at night
