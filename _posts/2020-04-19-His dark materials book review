Hi, i hope you are enjoying this website. Today I am going to do a book review of His Dark Materials book 1 The Northen Lights by Philip Pullman.

Story line so far *need to change this into a subtitle but i need to wat for dad to help me

At Jordan college a girl called lyra, who is the main character, loves playing on rooftops and exploring with her friend Roger but on one day Lyra and Roger heard about the Gobblers. The gobblers have been snatching children from all over the country. Another day in Jordan Lyra was going back to the college, when she reached the college she went and tried to find her best friend (Roger) she looked everywhere the kitchen where Roger worked and even the resting place of the past Masters of Jordan College. He was nowhere!
